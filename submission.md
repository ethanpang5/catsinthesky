Given more time, what would you have done differently? 
I would definitely touch up all of the CSS to make the website more accurate to the mockup and to iron out the small bad-looking styles (extra scrollbars, rectangular buttons, etc.). A lot of it comes down to the large number of ways something can be changed by the html and the css, and learning them all fully was difficult, when my main focus was to make sure all of the core functionality was there.

How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?
I think I ended up following the directions fairly closely, in attempt to recreate the mockup accurately but also because most of the tools I know are the same ones that were recommended. I know React, and used Bootstrap and Material UI because I was comfortable with them, which ended up being the suggested tools to use. Other than that, I used other React packages (Router, React-Bootstrap, etc.) and code snippets from various sources that I linked in the comments since the directions purposefully left that open ended.

Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
Just wanted to say I appreciated this style of technical interview where we get a take-home project to complete with relative freedom vs. getting drilled with tough and less applicable coding questions. It was pretty fun
